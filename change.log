 add more options of DL_DECAY method
1. can use the fixed softening length as the original dark matter particles's, by invalidate UNEQUALSOFTENINGS
2. new born particle can be placed outside the softening length of the mother, by active DECAY_PLACE_OUT_SOFTENING
NOTICE:
  DECAY_DARK_MATTER CAN NOT BE USED TOGETHER WITH "ADAPTIVE_GRAVSOFT_FORGAS"

1. the soften_length of decay particle is set to ForceSoften instead.

1. borned particle chooses a softening [2*G*M(t)/Vk/Vk/a]. the large mass particle keep its
   softening as specified by the input, at any time the small particle has the softening larger or equal to the large mass 
   one.
2. the time step now is determined by the softening of large particle
3. when evaluating gravity for large mass, tree node will be open if the node has the small mass particle inside to eliminate 
   the influence of the large softening of small particles on the node.
4. This scheme tends to make the early decayed small mass particle more easily be caught by surrounding large mass particles.

5. This version is used for the paper

10-5-2012   [Version 0.1.1]
1. the born time of the decayed particle is recorded.
2. The new softening scheme for the decayed particle is [2*G*M(t)*a(now)/a^2(born)/Vk/Vk], so that early borned particle will have 
   a larger softening and the softening is increased with the time for cosmological simulations.
3. The tree node open condition is changed, so that if the target particle has a smaller softening than the node's maxsofteing, 
   the node is opened. Potentially this will slow the speed down more than 4 times, increase the PM grid may increse the speed.
     
2-04-2013   [Version 0.1.2]
1. design to fully implement the Peter algorithm, not done yet

4-5-2014  [Version 0.1.3]
1. add the feature of dealing the situation with non-zero initial daughter fraction.
2. this version is not designed for the zoom-in simulations.

5-20-2014 [Version 0.1.4 working]
Aim:
N-body code suitable for the zoom-in simulations
1. the zoom-in CDM simulation (multi-softening length, zoom-in force)
